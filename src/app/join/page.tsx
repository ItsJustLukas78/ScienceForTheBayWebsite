            Hi! Thank you so much for showing interest in working with us this year! Please use <a target="_blank" className="text-ascent" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdokuLv1ClGmd_8Rr6wm7jlzNwIsihf3MCfzczYgDYTZjs1mQ/viewform">this form</a> to let us know
            the times/days of the week you are available and we will get back to you shortly in order to
            confirm. Our lessons are once every two weeks for about 45 minutes, but the form includes a
            larger window of time due to the DHS bell schedule. We are so excited to get to know you and
            your class this year, so please do not hesitate to ask us any questions you might have (rao2536@mydusd.org)
